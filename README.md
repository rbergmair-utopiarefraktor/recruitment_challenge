# So1 Algorithm Team's Recruitment Challenge

Here at So1, we ("the algo" team) do your typical data-science-y things:
* We write a lot code (to make models, explore data, etc.)
* We pull our hair out when said code doesn't work
* We pull our hair out when said code works, but the models are crap
* We use git to manage our code
* We try to facilitate knowledge transfer through written media (read: we occasional write notes to each other)
 
Justifiably, 1-in-3 of our data scientists are bald, and So1 occasionally sponsors experimental hair replacement surgeries‡.

However, aside from your typical data-sciencey things, we are always looking for new talent to join the team. To give you a taste of the kind of work we do here, and the way we do our work, we've made this git repo, and some fake data for you to noodle around with. Completing this challenge꙳ requires:
* command of at least one programming language (we mainly use R, but other languages are okay)
* a basic fluency in git

### Directions:
1. Fork this repo.
2. Download the [training data](link_to_amazon_s3), or (if you're a CLI junkie) use
   
    ```
    wget http://link.to.amazon
    ```
3. Load up your favorite text editor (mine is Vim :wink:) and start playing with/modeling the data.
4. When you're done꙳, initialize a Pull Request, and we'll checkout what you've done and benchmark your predictions.
 
### ꙳ -- What does it mean to complete this challenge?


‡: So1 doesn't actually offer experimental hair surgery as an (explicit) employee benefit.
